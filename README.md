# Lightning Line - Digital Queue Management System for Tax Offices

## Group: Skynet

## Project Overview
**Lightning Line** is an advanced web application designed to revolutionize queue management in tax offices by reducing waiting times and improving operational efficiency through digitalization and intelligent service prioritization.

## Key Features

### Visitor Experience
- **Digital Check-in**: Visitors can check in via kiosk terminals or personal mobile devices
- **Smart Queue Assignment**: Receive queue numbers with real-time estimated waiting times
- **Service Type Categorization**: Dynamic queue management based on:
  - Payments processing
  - Document processing and filing
  - General inquiries and consultations
  - Urgent/priority cases

### Administrative Capabilities
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live monitoring of queue flow and service status
- **Priority Management**: Staff can prioritize urgent cases and special requirements
- **Analytics & Reporting**:
  - Average service time tracking
  - Peak hour identification and analysis
  - Service efficiency metrics
  - Staff performance monitoring

### Advanced Technology Integration
- **Machine Learning Engine**: Predictive waiting time estimation using historical and real-time data
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Queue optimization based on service complexity and staff availability
- **Multi-platform Accessibility**: Responsive web design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React.js with responsive design
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express.js REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis for caching
- **Machine Learning**: Python (Scikit-learn/TensorFlow) for predictive analytics
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket implementation for live queue updates
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with CI/CD pipeline

## Target Impact
- **Waiting Time Reduction**: 40-60% decrease in average waiting periods
- **Service Efficiency**: 30% improvement in daily service capacity
- **Visitor Satisfaction**: Enhanced customer experience through transparency and predictability
- **Operational Insights**: Data-driven decision making for resource allocation

## Development Roadmap
1. **Phase 1**: Core queue management system (2 months)
2. **Phase 2**: Admin dashboard and analytics (1.5 months)
3. **Phase 3**: Machine learning integration (2 months)
4. **Phase 4**: Mobile app and advanced features (1.5 months)
