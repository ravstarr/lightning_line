Project Description: Lightning Line will be a web application, specifically a digital queue
management system for tax offices. Tax offices are notorious for long, unmanaged waiting
times and a lack of service prioritization. The system aims to reduce waiting times and
improve efficiency in day-to-day services.
Our proposed system will allow visitors to check in digitally, either at a kiosk or on their
mobile devices and receive a queue number with an estimated waiting time. The system will
dynamically adjust queues based on service type, such as payments, document processing or
inquiries and assign them appropriately.
On the staff side, administrators and management will be able to monitor queue flow in real
time, prioritize urgent cases and view analytics like average service time and peak hours.
To make the waiting-time estimates during busy and slow periods more accurate, we plan to
include a machine learning model trained with data as well.
